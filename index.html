    <h1>RFA Reference Letter</h1>

<p>
    Rocket FActory Augsburg AG is a young international space startup. It was founded in 2018. <br/>
    as a spin-off of the OHB Group on the belief that flexible access to space will revolutionize space <br/>
    services and the way we can improve life on earth. RFA is developing space launch solution for <br/>
    low cost access to space in a unique set up.<br/> </p>
<p>
    During my internship at RFA, where I served as a Test Data Intern, my passion for programming was ignited<br/>
    as I immersed myself in coding tasks throughout the duration of my role. This experience became a pivotal<br/>
    point in my professional journey, prompting me to delve deeper into the world of programming. Motivated by<br/>
    the dynamic nature of the tasks at RFA, I embarked on a dedicated path of continuous learning, expanding my <br/>
    programming skills and exploring various facets of the field. My time at RFA not only honed my technical <br/>
    abilities but also sparked a keen interest in web development. Eager to broaden my expertise, I have since <br/>
    dedicated myself to acquiring knowledge in web development and related technologies. This journey reflects <br/>
    my commitment to excellence and continuous growth in the realm of programming, making me a valuable asset <br/>
    with a diverse skill set for any future endeavors.<br/></p>
